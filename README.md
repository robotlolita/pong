Pong
====

A simple single player Pong game made using Evas and Ecore (from the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries).

To run it you'll need to compile Evas and Ecore, and the EFL Python
bindings.

You can get all this stuff from the Enlightenment website:

    http://www.enlightenment.org/
    
Information on how to build the Python bindings is available there as
well:

    http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Python
    

Run
---

After installing the bindings, just run the `pong` script:

    ./pong
    
or
    
    python pong
